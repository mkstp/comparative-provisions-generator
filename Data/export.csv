$565 million over five years to support housing in First Nations Self-Governing and Modern Treaty Holders communities;
$845 million over seven years to support housing in Inuit communities; and

The federal government remains committed to the Act’s full and effective implementation, in partnership with Indigenous peoples.

Budget 2022 announces the government’s intention to replace the First Nations Land Management Act—which empowers First Nations to opt out of Indian Act provisions related to land management and replace them with their own laws—with the Framework Agreement on First Nation Land Management Act. This shorter, simpler legislation will continue to advance the First Nations Land Management Regime by giving force of law to the nation-to-nation Framework Agreement on First Nation Land Management.

Section: Indigenous Economic Participation in Trans Mountain
Reference: 
Text: Once completed, the Trans Mountain Expansion Project will be an integral part of Canada’s long term energy infrastructure. Over the life of the pipeline, the Trans Mountain Corporation will generate billions in cash flow. The federal government believes that Indigenous communities along the project corridor and marine shipping route should have the opportunity to participate in the economic opportunity created by the project. Indigenous economic participation in Trans Mountain can serve as a significant source of ongoing funds for those communities’ economic development and a further step in the development of an alternative model for Indigenous partnership in natural resource development in Canada.
